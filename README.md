## Name of whatever i'm finna make it 
A Java-based program to help university students or students in general by providing them a better way to see the screen.

## Tag line because those are nessary if you wanna look tough bruh
(details on what the tagline is explaining)

## Open Source Doucmentation
Since this project is supposed to improve upon's peoples ability to learn documentation bout what the code does is also going to be provide (WIP). Here's a list of diffrent documentation resources directly related to this project :
- [**Setup and installation for windows**](Link)
- [**Code explainination doc**](Link)
- [**Addtional libraries and third party projects**](Link)

## Recommend location upon installation
Theres gonna be a photo here outlining where extacly I would perffer for the document to be installed.
(photo)
I Reccomened having the application's start up icon here as it would allow for easy access. As a university student you'll have a more cramped time schedule then you would as a highscool student as well as less time for you to make it to classes or set-up before a class that why having the start shortcut will help you incase of you have the need to setup and view the screen as quick as you can.I would also perffer instaltion in this area as it would be able to dirrect you to ALL the files that were needed to run and use this software. This way in the chance of **uninstallation** all my program has to do is delete it's own file.

## software testers ##
Incase of a new device not being able to be paired. Try heading towards (blank incase of camera that need drivers or what not)
